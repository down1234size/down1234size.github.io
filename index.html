        <h3>Our Story: ...(as told by a customer)</h3>
            <p>My wife and I enjoyed meeting Jacob Lawson. We needed his help on a project too big for us to handle. One work day when lunchtime came around we invited Jake to join us for a meal. During the course of the meal Jacob explained how he happened to start his business, TLR. 

                I think Jake’s story is one we can all learn from. Jacob, like many of us from time to time, was faced with adversity and needed to act. It’s my belief that Jake set an expample for how people should respond when dealing with a problem.
                
                Jake excelled at baseball. He was such a good catcher that he had thoughts of pursuing a baseball career. About that time he found the love of his life. This changed his priority from playing ball to providing for their future together. As a result he found a job with a large engineering firm that paid well. 
                
                Jacob’s new job provided him with many opportunities to gain experience and develop new skills. Jake worked on a wide variety of large development projects operating all kinds of heavy equipment. He was so good at his job that his employer worked him long hours for weeks with little time off.
                
                When Jacob’s first child was born he found himself needing to spend more time with his family. But the engineering firm had other ideas. Employer demands were inflexible. The company would not change their wants to assist with his needs.  Jake had a problem!
                
                As a result of hard work, saving, and good fortune Jacob had been able to buy some land near Lathrop Missouri. He built his home there and enjoyed what little free time he had at his home with family and friends. His wife created a web site where their family experiences could be shared with others. Their home came to be known affectionately as The Lawson Ranch, TLR. 
                
                Jacob realized that he could not have enough time with his family while working for the company. So, he started his own excavating business. The family website became the name of his business, TLR. Jake’s business continues to grow. Now TLR provides Jacob with the happiness that he sought and earned. </p>

        <blockquote>
 	<p>"We had Jake come out and quote rebuilding our roughly 1/4 mile driveway. He arrived promptly when he said he would, and had my quote to me within a couple of days. Price was good and he worked us into his schedule. Our driveway has never looked this good. He has done an amazing job and communicated with everything he would be doing. I highly recommend TLR Excavating."</p>

            <p>"We had enjoyed our quarter acre pond for over 20 years. But, time had taken its tole. The dike could no hold back water due to erosion, plant damage, muskrats, and crayfish. Fixing it would be no DIY job. We needed someone with experience, equipment, and skill. That someone was Jacob Lawson. Jacob did a remarkable job!  In addition to being a delight to to work with he took only two days to totally rebuild  our dike. The dike was not only repaired but also improved to a level far above its original condition. Instead of a liability the pond is once again a feature that adds real value to our home. THANK YOU JACOB!"</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Our driveway was just some gravel spread on the ground. It required regular maintenance. I did the work often using a shovel and a rake. In order to replace the gravel with asphalt it would cost me a bundle. The cost would be around $15,000 for asphalt and around $30,000 for cement. On the other hand if TLR were to rebuild my driveway using gravel it would cost a small fraction of that amount. At the same time TLR could eliminate problems caused by poor drainage. By adding enough of the right kind of gravel and compacting as a finishing step the maintenance would be no greater than that required for asphalt or cement. Needless to say I had TLR do the job. They finished the work in two days without blocking access to our garage. It looks great! The driveway to our home is bigger and better than ever and will last for years thanks to TLR."</p>
